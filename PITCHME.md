@title[Category theory]

### Abstraction
### Composition
### Identity

Note:
Abstraction - getting rid of some unnecessary details => objects become identical
Composition - arguably, the most important feature
Identity

Composition and identity are the foundation of the category theory

Category - is a bunch of objects (might be a set but not always)
Sets - belongs to
Set of sets, set of all sets etc
Category is a bunch of objects + morphisms

An object - has no property, no structure
Morphism - no property except that is has a beginning and an end
A category could be considered as a graph - 1 or multiple arrows between 2 nodes, both ways
All morphism could be considered as a multiplication table (all the information),
you have an a morphism  and   then you have an arrow

Identity - every object has a identity
